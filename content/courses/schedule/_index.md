    All our group classes take about 1 month to complete. A new course starts roughly once a month and the start dates can be seen below. It is recommended to join each course on the day it starts as joining later makes catching up difficult.

    Morning classes take place between 9:00 and 12:00. Afternoon classes are held between 13:00 and 16:00. Evening classes take place between 18:00 and 20:00.
    
    Private lessons with flexible schedules are also available.
