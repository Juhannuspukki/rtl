    All our group classes take about 1 month to complete. A new course starts roughly once a month on the dates visible below. It is recommended to join each course on the day it starts as joining later may make catching up difficult!

    Morning classes take place between 9:00 and 12:00. Afternoon classes are held between 13:00 and 16:00. Evening classes take place between 18:00 and 20:00.
    
    Private lessons with flexible schedules are also available both on weekdays and weekends.

    To check course availability, please see our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/rtlschool/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rtlschool/) or [contact us](/courses/schedule).
