        We don’t expect you to make a decision about studying with RTL school without knowing what it’s really like. You are free to come to our office every day (holidays and weekends excluded) and ask to join one of our classes!
    
        The first course you take at Rak Thai Language School  is Speaking Level 1.   
    
        During Speaking Level 1 you familiarize yourself with Thai vowels and consonants and the five tones of Thai language. Students will also learn a phonetic writing system for reading and writing Thai. After that, you learn basic vocabulary and practice basic conversations covering topics ranging from introducing yourself, ordering food, asking directions, to expressing preferences and comparing things.

        After Speaking Level 1 you are ready to move to Level 2.
    
        Speaking Level 2 introduces more vocabulary and more complex speaking patterns. The teacher also speaks faster, which might be overwhelming at first. However, you soon get used to it and it will help you understand the everyday speech of native Thai people.

        On Speaking Level 3, conversations are almost completely free-form. The strong foundations you have learned during the previous courses makes it possible for you to understand the teacher even though he or she explains concepts almost exclusively in Thai language.
    
        By the end of this course the student will have a strong foundation in the Thai language and is able to speak confidently in everyday conversations, having built up many conversation patterns and an extensive vocabulary. During the duration of this course at almost at the same speed as most native Thai speakers. This will greatly increase your listening comprehension abilities.
    
        After successfully completing this course you will find that Thai people frequently tell you that *khun phuut 
        phasaa Thai keng mak!*
    
        Learning does not stop here, however. We also have many more courses to offer covering speaking, reading, writing and more specialized topics.
