    People studying at RTL choose to stay in a variety of places. This includes hotels, renting a condominium and some long-term residents have even decided to buy a house or a condo in Thailand.

    Most people prefer to rent a condominium or a house because it is significantly cheaper than staying in a hotel orAirBnb. However, it can be difficult to find a furnished condominium to rent in Thailand, especially if you are staying for less than a year. If you find it challenging to find a place to stay, do not hesitate to contact our partner real estate agent. She will help you to find a condominium or house that is suitable for your budget and within a reasonable distance from the school. Rental contracts are provided in English and Thai.
