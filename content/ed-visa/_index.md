    - question: How much does the ED Visa cost?
      answer:
        To obtain the ED Visa, you are required to purchase 3 courses. Ministry of Education will not grant 
        the visa without the full tuition having been paid. The total cost for such a package including the processing fee for MoE is 24 500 baht. In addition, the Immigration Bureau will charge you 2000 baht for the visa itself. Each extension of the ED visa costs 1900 baht (must be extended at Immigration Bureau every 2 months).
    - question: Can I apply for this type of Visa if I am already in Thailand?
      answer: Yes! To obtain the ED Visa, enter Thailand with a tourist visa and then talk to us. We can change your tourist visa or visa exemption to an ED Visa. Please note that other visa types cannot be changed to an ED Visa.
    - question: How long does it take to obtain the ED Visa?
      answer: Obtaining the ED Visa means you need to get approval from two authorities; The Ministry of Education and the Immigration Bureau. The process can be somewhat lengthy and you should have at least 35-45 days left on your current tourist visa before talking to us.
