    - question: How much does the ED Visa cost?
      answer: |-
        The total cost for our ED Visa package including the processing fee for Ministry of Education and 3 courses is 24 500 baht. The tuition must be paid beforehand, as otherwise the Ministry will not accept the application.
        
        Please note that this price does not include the fees by the Immigration Bureau.
    - question: How much will the Immigration Bureu charge me?
      answer: The fee for an ED Visa is 2000 baht and it is valid for 3 months. Each extension of the ED Visa costs 1900 baht and it and extensions are granted for 2 months at a time by the Immigration Bureau for the duration of advanced and intermediate studies.
    - question: Can I apply for this type of Visa if I am already in Thailand?
      answer: Yes! To obtain the ED Visa, enter Thailand with a tourist visa and then talk to us. We can change your tourist visa or visa exemption to an ED Visa. Please note that other visa types cannot be changed to an ED Visa.
    - question: How long does it take to obtain the ED Visa?
      answer: Obtaining the ED Visa means you need to get approval from two authorities; The Ministry of Education and the Immigration Bureau. The process can be somewhat lengthy and you should have at least 35-45 days left on your current tourist visa before talking to us.
    - question: I already speak some Thai, can I start from the intermediate level?
      answer: The Ministry of Education requires that all students start from the basic level.
    - question: If the application is rejected, can I get a refund?
      answer: Regrettably we are unable to offer refunds. However, the courses you have purchased do not need to be used right away. When you purchase 3 months of courses, you can use them at any time in the future.
    - question: I have previously studied another language in Thailand, can I get a new ED Visa for studying Thai?
      answer: Yes! Please bring us the transcript and a certificate.
    - question: Do I have to do the 90-day reports?
      answer: Yes, it is the policy of the Immigration Bureu that all foreigners residing in Thailand must report their address to the Immigration Bureau every 90 days. This also applies to those with the ED Visa. This is easier as it used to be, as in most cases reporting can be done online or by booking an appointment with the Immigration Bureau online to avoid queues. 
    - question: What happens if I leave Thailand with the ED Visa?
      answer: If you leave Thailand, *your ED Visa is immediately cancelled* and you re-enter with a tourist visa. If you wish to re-enter Thailand and keep your ED Visa, it is very important that you purchase a re-entry permit before leaving the country. A single-use re-entry permit costs 1000 baht and can be purchased at border checkpoints and airports.
    - question: Are there any other reports or documents I should know about?
      answer: A form called TM30 is filled by the hotel, condo or house owner when a foreigner stays in their property. This can be done online. Hotels are familiar with the practice, but house and condo owners might not be be aware of the regulation if this is the first time they are renting property to a foreigner. Please ask them to fill the TM30 form. It is also a good practice to ask them to send you a screenshot of the filled TM30 form. While TM30 is technically not your responsibility, the Immigration Bureau occasionally asks to see some kind of proof of the filled form.
